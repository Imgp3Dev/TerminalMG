# How it works:
So Let's start off with Kik first. TerminalMG will act off Kik bot API and use it a way of interacting Via terminal(Like Using the terminal to modify something without changing it via code) so pretty much the terminal interface will be in the control of a Bot which will have many features. 

Example description of the Kik terminal:
Let's say You wanted to change your profile with a particular cmd When you do input the particular Cmd The bot will act off it. When you inputted the cmd the code changed for the bot automatically for the purpose of changing your Profile. And the crazy part is that it will seem like an External Bot.

And For Twitter A Bot API will also be used.

Twitter Terminal features:

Retweet bots

Ability to clone other users accounts

Ability to make accounts follow you.

Note:
Of course there will be features like the orginal Twitter such as scrolling up or down, liking tweets, etc.
